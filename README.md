Investing app for learning purposes

The aim is to be able to search different assets like cryptocurrencies and precious metals. Those can then be saved to the user's personal watchlist and also a portfolio, where they can input their amounts of each and have a neat dashboard to display the whole thing; distribution, total asset worth etc. 

Currently, it can:

-   search coins by name using coingecko API
-   add coins to user's watchlist (localStorage for now)
-   display user's list of coins
