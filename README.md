# Investing app for learning purposes

The aim is to be able to search different assets like cryptocurrencies and precious metals. Those can then be saved to the user's personal watchlist and also a portfolio, where they can input their amounts of each and have a neat dashboard to display the whole thing; distribution, total asset worth etc. 

Currently, it can:

-   search coins by name using coingecko API
-   view an asset on a separate page with market stats and a working price/market cap chart
-   add coins to user's watchlist
-   display user's watchlist
-   'deposit' coins from the portfolio page and display them in a pie chart and table
